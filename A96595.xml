            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>And as <hi>Corah</hi> and his companions were ſo nearly allyed unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> of the tribe of <hi>Levi;</hi> ſo <hi>Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram</hi> were men <hi>famous</hi> in the Congregation, noble Peers and very popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar men, <hi>heads of their</hi> families of the Tribe of <hi>Reuben.</hi> A ſubtle practiſe of that peſtiferous Serpent, to joyn <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi,</hi> Clergy and Laity in this wicked faction of <hi>Rebellion;</hi> the one under colour of diſſembled <hi>ſanctity,</hi> the other with their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and uſurped <hi>authority,</hi> to ſeduce the <hi>more,</hi> to make the <hi>grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> breach of obedience.

<note place="margin">JACOB REX, in Ep. to all Chriſtian Monarchs.</note> as we ſee in all <hi>Societies</hi> and corporations of any mechanick craft or handy-work, they do inviolably obſerve that <hi>maxime</hi> of the Civill Law, to give an <hi>intereſt</hi> unto thoſe <hi>qui fovent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimilem cauſam:</hi> ſo that as birds of the <hi>ſame</hi> feather, they will <hi>cluſter</hi> all in one, and be <hi>zealous</hi> for the preſervation of them that are of the <hi>ſame</hi> craft or ſociety: why then ſhould not the <hi>profeſſion</hi> of the ſame <hi>Religion,</hi> if not <hi>increaſe</hi> affection, yet at leaſt <hi>detaine</hi> men from diſſention?</p>
               <p>For, though <hi>diverſities</hi> of Religion, <hi>non bene conveniunt,</hi> can ſeldome containe themſelves for any <hi>while</hi> in the ſame King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome without <hi>civill</hi> diſtractions, eſpecially if each party be of a neer <hi>equall</hi> power, which ſhould move all Governours to doe herein, as <hi>Haniball</hi> did with his army, that was a mixture of all Nations, to keepe the moſt <hi>ſuſpected</hi> under, and ranke them ſo, that they durſt not <hi>kicke</hi> againſt his <hi>Carthaginians:</hi> or is <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth did with the <hi>Brittaines</hi> to make ſuch laws

               <p n="4">4 Theſe Rebells had received many <hi>favours</hi> and great <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits</hi> from their Governours:

<note place="margin">Numb. 16.9</note> and ſet them neer to God himſelfe, to doe the ſervice of the Tabernacle of the Lord:</hi> and therefore the light of <hi>nature</hi> tells us, that they were moſt ungratefull, and as inhumane as the brood of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents that would ſting him to death, which to preſerve his life, would bring him home in his boſome.</p>
               <p>And it ſeems this was the <hi>tranſcendencie</hi> of <hi>Judas</hi> his ſinne,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:116031:7"/>and that which grieved our Saviour moſt of al, that he whom he had called to be one of the 12. Apoſtles, whom he had made his <hi>Steward</hi> and Treaſurer of all his wealth, &amp; for whom he had done more then for <hi>thouſands</hi> of others ſhould betray him into the hands of ſinners; for <hi>if it had been another</hi> (ſaith the Pſalmiſt) <hi>that had done me this diſhonour, I could well have bornc it,</hi> but ſeeing it was thou <hi>my familiar friend,</hi> which didſt <hi>eat and drinke at my table, it muſt needes trouble me:</hi> for though in others it might be <hi>pardonable,</hi> yet in thee it is <hi>intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable;</hi> and therefore of all others he ſaith of <hi>Judas, vae illi ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini,</hi> woe be unto that man by whom the Sonne of man is betrayed, <hi>it had beene better for him he had never been borne,</hi> as if his ſin were <hi>greater</hi> then the ſinnes of <hi>Ananias, Caiphas,</hi> of <hi>Pilate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the old ſaying is moſt true, <hi>Improbus à nullo flectitur obſequio,</hi> no <hi>ſervice</hi> can ſatisfie a froward ſoule, no <hi>favour,</hi> no <hi>benefit,</hi> no preferment can appeaſe the <hi>rebellious</hi> thoughts of diſcontented ſpirits. And therefore notwithſtanding <hi>Moſes</hi> had done all this for <hi>Corah,</hi> yet <hi>Corah</hi> muſt <hi>rebell</hi> againſt <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes:</hi> So many times, though Kings have given great honours unto their ſubjects, made them their <hi>Peeres,</hi> their <hi>Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laines,</hi> their <hi>Treaſurers,</hi> and their <hi>ſervants</hi> of <hi>neareſt</hi> place, and <hi>greateſt</hi> truſt. And though <hi>Aaron</hi> the High Prieſt, or <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop</hi> doth impoſe his <hi>hands</hi> on others, and admit them into <hi>ſacred</hi> Orders above their brethren, to be neare the Lord, and beſtow all the <hi>preferment</hi> they can upon them: yet with <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah</hi> theſe unquiet and <hi>ungratefull</hi> ſpirits muſt rebell againſt their governours: For, I think I may well demand, <hi>which</hi> of all of them, that now rebell againſt their King have not had, either their Grand-fathers, Fathers, or themſelves promoted to <hi>all</hi> or <hi>moſt</hi> of their fortunes and honours, from that crown which now they would trample under their feet?

                  <q>—Rex idem hominum, Phoebique Sacerdos.</q> And the Apoſtle ſaith of <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> that hee was both a King and the Prieſt of the moſt high God,) did chuſe two <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall</hi> brethren to be the Governours of his people; and that, <hi>quod non caret myſterio: Aanon</hi> was the eldeſt, and yet <hi>Moſes</hi> was the chiefeſt; to ſignifie, as I take it, that they ſhould rather <hi>helpe</hi> and <hi>further</hi> each other, then any wayes <hi>rule</hi> and <hi>domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neere</hi> one over the other; becauſe that although <hi>Aaron</hi> was the <hi>eldeſt</hi> brother and <hi>chiefe</hi> Prieſt, yet <hi>Moſes</hi> was the <hi>chiefe</hi> Magiſtrate, and his brothers God, as God himſelfe doth ſtile him; and therefore this ſhould <hi>terrorem incutere,</hi> and teach him how to behave himſelfe towards his brother; and though <hi>Moſes</hi> was the <hi>chiefe</hi> Magiſtrate, yet <hi>Aaron</hi> was the <hi>chiefe</hi> Prieſt, and his eldeſt brother, which had not loſt (like <hi>Reuben</hi>) the prerogative of his birth-right; and this ſhould <hi>reverentiam inducere,</hi> worke in <hi>Moſes</hi> a reſpect unto his brothers age and place.</p>
               <p>And truly there is great <hi>reaſon</hi> why theſe two ſhould doe their beſt, to <hi>ſupport</hi> and protect each other; for the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the people, is, as we may now ſee, a very <hi>difficult</hi> and a

<note place="margin">As ſoone as men have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrowne their Prieſts, they will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently labour to deſtroy their King.</note> it hath been found moſt certaine, that after they have thrown away the <hi>Miter,</hi> they have not long retained the <hi>Scepter:</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore King <hi>James</hi> of ever bleſſed memory, of a ſharp concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and ſound judgement, was wont to ſay, <hi>No Biſhop, no King,</hi> unleſſe you meane ſuch a King as Chriſt was, when the <hi>Iewes</hi> crowned him with Thornes, and bowing their knees, ſaid, <hi>Hayle King of the Iewes;</hi> that is, <hi>Rex ſine Regno,</hi> a King with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out power; like a man of ſtraw, that is onely made to fright away the birds: For the people are alwayes <hi>prone</hi> to pull out their neeks from the yoke of their obedience, and would ſoone <hi>rebell,</hi> if the <hi>Prieſt</hi> did not continually preach, that <hi>Every ſoule ſhould be ſubject to the higher powers;</hi> as wee ſee now by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, how apt they are to <hi>rebell</hi> when factious Preachers give them the leaſt encouragement.

               <p>And here you may obſerve the method of their <hi>Rebellion,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The methode of their rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion.</note> the Text ſaith, <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron;</hi> yet <hi>Moſes</hi> ſheweth, they began with <hi>Aaron:</hi> for when their <hi>Rebellion</hi> was firſt diſcovered, <hi>Moſes</hi> doth not ſay, <hi>What have I done againſt you?</hi> but <hi>What is Aaron that you ſhould murmure againſt him?</hi> to ſhew unto us, that although <hi>Moſes</hi> was the <hi>firſt</hi> they aymed at in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, yet he was the <hi>laſt</hi> they purpoſed to overthrow in the execution: <hi>Quia progrediendum à facilioribus,</hi> as the Devil began with the woman the <hi>weaker</hi> veſſell, that he might the eaſier overthrow the <hi>ſtrougen;</hi> ſo the enemies of God and his Church doe alwayes ſeeke, firſt to overthrow the <hi>Prieſt,</hi> and then preſently they will ſet upon the <hi>Prince.</hi>

<note place="margin">Little feare of God in them that expell their Prieſts out of their ſocieties.</note> when they expell <hi>Aaron</hi> the chiefe Prieſt or Biſhop out of their Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, there is but little <hi>feare</hi> of God before their eyes: for if <hi>Seneca,</hi> that was but <hi>Natures</hi> Scholler, could tell us, that when we goe about any wicked act, a grave <hi>Cato</hi> or ſevere <hi>Ariſtides</hi> ſtanding by us, would make us <hi>bluſh</hi> and ſtop the doing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, then certainly the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> that hath any grace, will be <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed</hi> of his evill intent, and be <hi>afraid</hi> to offend God, when he ſeeth a <hi>man of God</hi> ſo neare him; who doth often times <hi>ponere obicem,</hi> make a ſtop to ſtay the proceedings of the wicked, that

               <p>And therefore the former ages that <hi>feared</hi> God more then we, and were <hi>wiſer</hi> to uſe this meanes,
<note place="margin">The wiſedome of the former age.</note> that they might feare him, deſired, that in their <hi>greateſt</hi> Aſſemblies of greateſt <hi>affaires,</hi> as <hi>Seſſions, Councels, Parliaments,</hi> and the like, the Biſhops and Preachers might be as the chiefe members of their conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, as well to <hi>witneſſe</hi> the uprightneſſe of their actions, and to <hi>direct</hi> them in caſes of conſcience, what is moſt agreeable to the divine conſtitution.</p>
               <p>And whereſoever you ſee the <hi>expulſion</hi> of theſe men,

<note place="margin">An impertinent example.</note> but being greedily deſirous to enlarge his territories, he incroached upon the others right, and for his injuſtice, was overcome by the ſword in a juſt battell: and therefore to conclude from hence, that becauſe the King of <hi>Iudah</hi> trefuſed to obey the King of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> therefore the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Magiſtrates or Peeres of any Kingdome may reſiſt and remove their lawfull Prince for his tyranny or impiety; ſurely this deſerves rather <hi>Fuſtibus tutundi quàm rationibus refellt;</hi> to be beaten with rods, then confuted with reaſons: as Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> ſpeaketh of the like Argument.</p>

<note place="margin">Pride the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion.</note> And then <hi>Pride,</hi> as the <hi>father,</hi> begat <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contentment</hi> as his <hi>eldeſt</hi> Sonne; they liked not their owne <hi>ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> but would faine bee promoted to <hi>higher</hi> dignity; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> were ſetled in the government <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> them, and they knew not how either to be <hi>adjoyned</hi> with

<note place="margin">2 Sam. 15.3, 4.</note>

               <p>And ſo now you ſee this <hi>ugly</hi> monſter the ſonne of <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Diſcontentment,</hi> is borne into the world, and ſpreads it ſelfe from the <hi>inward</hi> thought to <hi>open</hi> words.

               <p>And therefore leſt this <hi>fire</hi> ſhould conſume them, and theſe <hi>mutterers</hi> prove their murderers, <hi>Moſes</hi> now begins to look un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>himſelfe,</hi> and to anſwer for his <hi>brother;</hi> he calleth theſe <hi>rebels,</hi> and he telleth them, that neither <hi>he</hi> nor his <hi>brother</hi> had <hi>ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly</hi> uſurped, but were lawfully called into thoſe places; and to make this apparent to all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> he bade theſe <hi>Rebels</hi> come out of their Caſtles to ſome other place, where he might ſafely treate and conferre with them; and that was to the Tabernacle of the Lord: that is, to the place where <hi>wiſedome</hi> and <hi>truth</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided, and was from thence publiſhed and ſpread to all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and there the Lord ſhould ſhew them <hi>whom</hi> he had cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen.</p>
               <p>And here I doe obſerve the <hi>care</hi> and <hi>wiſedome</hi> of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, that at the <hi>firſt</hi> appearance of their deſigne,

                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:116031:49"/>begin to protect his brother, before their rebellion had <hi>increaſed</hi> to any ſtrength; for had he then delivered <hi>Aaron</hi> into their hands, his hands had beene ſo <hi>weakened,</hi> that he had never beene able afterwards to defend himſelfe; to teach <hi>all</hi> Kings to beware, that they yeeld not their <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Prieſts</hi> unto the deſires of the people, which is the <hi>fore-runner</hi> of rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt themſelves: for as King <hi>Philip</hi> told the <hi>Athenians,</hi> that he had no diſlike to <hi>them,</hi> but would admit them into his <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection,</hi> ſo they would deliver to him their <hi>Orators,</hi> which were the <hi>fomentors</hi> of all miſchiefe, and the people were mad to doe it,
<note place="margin">The witty tale of <hi>Demosthenes</hi> to ſaue the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators, and to aſſureal Kings that if <hi>Aarons</hi> tongue, &amp; the <hi>Prophets</hi> pen perſwade not the conſcience to yeeld obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <hi>Moſes</hi> power and <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhuas</hi> ſword may ſubdue the people to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver retaine them long without rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion.</note> till <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> told them, how the <hi>Wolfe</hi> made the ſame propoſition unto the <hi>Sheepe</hi> to become their <hi>friends</hi> and protectors, ſo they would deliver their <hi>Dogs,</hi> which were the <hi>cauſe</hi> of all diſcontent betwixt them, and the <hi>Sheepe</hi> being <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready</hi> weary of their <hi>Dogs,</hi> delivered them <hi>all</hi> unto the <hi>Wolves,</hi> and then <hi>immediately</hi> the <hi>Wolves</hi> ſpared neither <hi>Sheepe</hi> nor <hi>Lambe,</hi> but tore them in pieces without <hi>reſiſtance:</hi> even ſo, when any <hi>King</hi> yeeldeth his <hi>Biſhops</hi> unto the poples Votes, he may feare ere <hi>long</hi> to feele the ſmart of this great maſtake.</p>
               <p>Therefore <hi>Moſes</hi> wiſely delivereth not his <hi>brother,</hi> but <hi>ſtoutly</hi> defendeth <hi>him,</hi> who he knew had no wayes offended <hi>them,</hi> and offered, if they came to a <hi>convenient</hi> place, to make this plaine to all the people.</p>
               <p>But as <hi>evill</hi> weeds grow apace, and <hi>lewd</hi> ſonnes will not be kept under, ſo the more <hi>Moſes</hi> ſought to ſuppreſſe this ſinne, the faſter it grew, and ſpread it ſelfe to many branches; from <hi>ſecret</hi> muttering, to <hi>open</hi> rayling, from <hi>inward</hi> diſcontent, to <hi>outward</hi> diſobedience, they tell them <hi>plainely</hi> to their faces, <hi>they will not come,
<note place="margin">Evil mengrow worſe, &amp; worſ.

               <p>So now <hi>Moſes</hi> might well ſay with the Poet,
<q>Quocunque aſpicio nihil eſt niſi pontus,

I am ſure his Majeſty was neither the <hi>cauſe,</hi> nor doth he deſire the <hi>prolonging</hi> thereof for the leaſt moment; but as his <hi>royall</hi> father was a moſt <hi>peaceable</hi> Prince, ſo hath he ſhewed himſelfe in all his life, to follow him <hi>paſſibus aequis,</hi> and to be a <hi>Prince of peace:</hi> though, as the <hi>God of peace</hi> is likewiſe a man of warre, and the <hi>Lord of Hoſts;</hi> ſo this <hi>peaceable Prince,</hi> when his <hi>patience</hi> is too much provoked, can (as you ſee) change his <hi>pen</hi> for a <hi>ſword,</hi> and turne the <hi>milde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> of a Lambe into the <hi>ſtoutneſſe</hi> of a Lyon; and you know what <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, that <hi>The wrath of a King is the meſſenger of death,</hi> eſpecially when he is ſo <hi>justly</hi> moved to wrath. And ſo much for the <hi>particulars</hi> of this Text.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Having <hi>fully</hi> ſeene the <hi>uglineſſe</hi> of this ſinne,
<note place="margin">2. The puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of theſe rebels.</note> you may a little view the <hi>greatneſſe</hi> of the puniſhment: for,</p>
               <p>Although I muſt confeſſe, we ſhould be <hi>ſlow to anger,</hi> ſlow to wrath, yet when the <hi>Magistrate</hi> is diſobeyed, the <hi>Minister</hi> deſpiſed, and <hi>God</hi> himſelfe diſclaimed, it makes our hearts to <hi>bleed,</hi> and our ſpirits <hi>angry</hi> within us: yea, though the King were as <hi>gentle</hi> and as meek as <hi>Moſes,</hi> the <hi>meekest</hi> man on earth
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:116031:55"/>and the Biſhops as holy as <hi>Aaron, the Saint of the Lord;</hi> yet ſuch <hi>diſobedience</hi> and rebellion would anger Saints;
<note place="margin">Tirinus in h. pſal.</note> for ſo <hi>Tirinus</hi> ſaith, <hi>Irritaverunt, they angred Moſes in their Tents, and Aaron the Saint of the Lord:</hi> Nay more then this, they angred God himſelfe, ſo farre that <hi>fire was kindled in his wrath, and it bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the bottome of hell.</hi> And as theſe rebels were <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Levites,</hi> Clergy and Laity, ſo God did <hi>proportion</hi> their puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments according to their ſinnes: for the <hi>Levites,</hi> that were to kindle <hi>fire</hi> upon Gods Altar, and ſhould have beene more hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly, and thoſe 250 men which uſerped the Office of the Prieſts; <hi>He ſent fire from heaven</hi> to devour them: and the <hi>Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> that were <hi>Lay Lords,</hi> the Prophet tels you, <hi>the earth opened and ſwallowed up Dathan, and covered the Congregation of Abiram.</hi> A moſt fearfull example of a <hi>juſt</hi> judgment; for to have ſeene them <hi>de ad</hi> upon the earth, as the <hi>Egiptians</hi> upon the ſhore, had beene very lamentable; but to ſee the earth <hi>open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and the graves devouring them <hi>quick,</hi> was moſt lamertable, and ſo ſtrange that we never read of <hi>ſuch</hi> revenge taken of <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Baſiil. hom 9.</note> never any better deſerved, and which is more, S. <hi>Baſil</hi> ſaith <hi>quod deſcenderunt in infernum damnatorum:</hi> they fell into the very pit of the damned; which dolefull judgement, though they well deſerved it, yet I will leave that undetermined.</p>
               <p>And if <hi>theſe</hi> rebels proceeding not ſo <hi>farre,</hi> whatſover they intended to offer violence, and to make an open <hi>war</hi> againſt <hi>Moſes,</hi> were ſo <hi>heavily</hi> plagued for the <hi>Embrio</hi> of their rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, what tongue ſhall be able to expreſſe the <hi>deteſtation</hi> of that ſinne, and the <hi>deſerts</hi> of <hi>thoſe</hi> rebels, that by their <hi>ſubtilty</hi> and <hi>cruelty</hi> would bring a <hi>greater</hi> perſecution upon the Church then any that we read ſince the time of Chriſt, and by a deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate diſobedience to a moſt <hi>Gratious King,</hi> would <hi>utterly</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw a moſt flouriſhing State? a <hi>rebellion</hi> and <hi>perſecution,</hi> the one againſt the <hi>King:</hi> the other againſt the <hi>Church,</hi> that in <hi>all</hi> reſpects can ſcarce be <hi>paralleled</hi> from the beginning of the world to this very day.</p>
               <p>And therefore except they doe <hi>ſpeedily</hi> repent with that <hi>mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi> of repentance, as ſhall be in ſome ſort <hi>proportionable</hi> to the meaſure of their tranſgreſſion, I feare God in <hi>justice</hi> will deale

               </p>
               <p>And ſo much for the words of this Text.</p>
               <p>Now to <hi>Apply</hi> all in briefe: if God ſhall ſay to any Nation,
<note place="margin">The applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all.</note> 
                  <hi>I will ſend them a King in my wrath, and give them Lawes not good:</hi> let them take heed they ſay not we will take him away by our ſtrength: for we have read, that hee hath <hi>authority</hi> to give us a King in his <hi>diſpleaſure:</hi> but you ſhall never read that we have <hi>authority</hi> to diſobey him at our <hi>pleaſure,</hi> and to ſay, <hi>Nolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus hunc regnare ſuper nos:</hi> or if any do, let them know that he which <hi>ſet</hi> him up, and <hi>ſetled</hi> him over them, is able to <hi>protect</hi> him againſt them; &amp; they that <hi>ſtruggle</hi> againſt him, do but ſtrive againſt <hi>God:</hi> and therefore they have no better remedie, then to <hi>pray</hi> to God, which hath the <hi>hearts</hi> of Kings in his hand, that he would, as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſaith, <hi>Give the King his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and his righteouſneſſe unto the Kings Son</hi> that he would either <hi>guide</hi> his heart to right, and <hi>direct</hi> his feete to the way of peace: or as he hath ſent him in his <hi>fury,</hi> ſo hee would take him away in his <hi>mercy.</hi> But for our <hi>ſelves</hi> of theſe Ilands we have a King and I ſpeak it here in the <hi>ſight</hi> of God and as I ſhall anſwer for what I ſay at the dreadfull <hi>judgement,</hi> not to <hi>flatter</hi> him that heares mee not, but to <hi>informe</hi> thoſe of you that know him not ſo well as I, that had the happineſſe to live with my ever honoured Lord, the Noble Earle of <hi>Pembroke</hi> and <hi>Montgomery,</hi> 16. or 17. yeares in the Kings houſe, and of them 6. or 7. yeares in the Kings ſervice. He is a moſt <hi>juſt, pious,</hi> and <hi>gracious</hi> King; and I beleeve the beſt Proteſtant King that ever England or Ireland ſaw, neither <hi>Popiſhly</hi> affected, nor <hi>Sciſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically</hi> led to diſaffect, but moſt conſtantly reſolved to be a <hi>true</hi>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:116031:56"/>Defender of that <hi>true Proteſtant</hi> Faith, which is eſtabliſhed by Law in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and he is ſuch a King; of ſo <hi>unblameable</hi> life, ſo <hi>ſpotleſſe</hi> in all his actions, ſo <hi>clement,</hi> and ſo meeke towards <hi>all</hi> men, and ſo <hi>mercifull</hi> towards his very <hi>enemies,</hi> that the mouth of <hi>Envie</hi> cannot truly tax him, nor <hi>malice</hi> it ſelfe diſprove him in any thing. Yet wee know that as <hi>Moſes</hi> the meekeſt among men, and <hi>David</hi> the beſt of Kings, were ſore afflicted, ſlandered, and perſecuted, not a little, by many of their owne obliged ſubjects; yea, and the beſt Kings have had the greateſt troubles; ſo this <hi>good</hi> King hath had for his tryall a great part of the like uſage. I know not by whom, neither do I indend here to accuſe others, but to inſtruct you, and by what I ſhewed out of this text to teach you <hi>above all,</hi> to take heed of <hi>diſobedience</hi> and Rebellion towards your King: and to let you underſtand that what <hi>privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges</hi> in the <hi>New</hi> Teſt. are acknowledged to be due to <hi>Heathen</hi> Princes, and what <hi>prerogatives</hi> the ſpirit of God hath in the <hi>Old</hi> Teſtament, warranted unto the Jewiſh Kings, and what the univerſall Law of <hi>Nature,</hi> hath eſtabliſhed upon all the <hi>ſupreme</hi> Governours, do all of them appertaine by <hi>unquestionable</hi> right unto his moſt ſacred Majeſty; and yet his Majeſty out of His <hi>incomparable</hi> goodneſſe inſiſteth not to challenge <hi>all</hi> theſe, but vouchſafeth to accept of <hi>theſe</hi> rights and prerogatives, which are undoubtedly afforded him by the Lawes of His own Lands: and theſe come far ſhort, ſcarce the moity of the other; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we know, if our Hiſtorians have not deceived mee, how many of them were obtained, by little better then by force and violence, compelling Kings to conſent unto them; whereas Lawes ſhould be of a freer nature.</p>
               <p>And therefore of all the Nations round about us, beſides that God hath intruſted Him with us all, wee have <hi>moſt</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to entruſt him, and to give credit unto His Majeſties <hi>many</hi> proteſtations (too high to be <hi>forgotten</hi> by him, or <hi>miſdoubted</hi> by us) for His reſolution, to maintaine the Liberty of his Subjects, the <hi>just Priviledges of Parliaments,</hi> and the <hi>true eſtabliſhed</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in the Kingdome of <hi>England:</hi> and likewiſe to rule over us according to our <hi>Lawes,</hi> in this Realme of <hi>Ireland.</hi> And
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:116031:56"/>we have <hi>leaſt</hi> reaſon to <hi>rebell</hi> and take armes againſt him; and therfore let us not be perſwaded by <hi>any meanes</hi> by any man to doe it, becauſe God will <hi>preſerve</hi> his annointed, and will, as you ſee, <hi>plague</hi> the Rebels; but let us <hi>pray</hi> for our King, and <hi>praiſe</hi> God night and day, that he which might have given us a <hi>bramble,</hi> not onely to <hi>teare</hi> our fleſh, but alſo to ſet us all on fire, hath given us ſuch a <hi>Cedar,</hi> ſuch a <hi>gracious</hi> and a <hi>pious</hi> King; and if either <hi>forreigne</hi> foes, or <hi>domeſtique</hi> Rebels, doe preſſe him ſo, that he hath <hi>need</hi> of us, let us adde our <hi>helpe,</hi> and hazard our <hi>lives</hi> to defend and protect Him that protecteth us; and ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth <hi>all</hi> for the protection of Gods ſervice, as it was <hi>eſtabliſhed</hi> in the <hi>pureſt</hi> time of Reformation, and for the preſervation of our <hi>Lawes</hi> from any <hi>corrupt</hi> interpretation, or <hi>arbitrary</hi> invaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon them, by thoſe <hi>factious</hi> men, that under <hi>faire,</hi> yet <hi>falſe</hi> pretences, have, with <hi>wondrous</hi> ſubtilty, and with moſt ſubtile hypocriſie, ſeduced ſo many <hi>ſimple</hi> men, to pertake with them not onely to <hi>overthrow</hi> the <hi>true</hi> Religion, to <hi>imbaſe</hi> the Church of Chriſt, that <hi>hitherto</hi> hath continued glorious in this Nation, and by <hi>trampling</hi> the moſt learned under feet, to reduce <hi>Popery</hi> into this Kingdome, and to bring in <hi>Atheiſme</hi> or <hi>Barbariſme</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our Pulpits, when they make their <hi>Coach-men</hi> and <hi>Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> like <hi>Jeroboams</hi> Prieſts, the baſeſt of the people, to become their <hi>trencher</hi> Chaplaines and the <hi>teachers</hi> of thoſe poore <hi>ſheep,</hi> for whom the Son of God hath ſhed his <hi>precious</hi> bloud, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to <hi>change</hi> the well-ſetled government, and to <hi>ſubvert</hi> the whole fabricke of this <hi>famous</hi> Common-wealth, either by their <hi>tyranny,</hi> or bringing all into an <hi>Anarchie;</hi> for if we have <hi>any</hi> regard of any of theſe things, either <hi>true</hi> Religion, or <hi>ancient</hi> Government; a <hi>gracious</hi> King, and a <hi>learned</hi> Clergy; a <hi>glorious</hi> Church, and a <hi>flouriſhing</hi> Kingdome; we ought not to <hi>ſpare</hi> our goods, or be <hi>niggards</hi> in our contributions to helpe his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie: yea, as <hi>Debora</hi> ſaith, <hi>To helpe the Lord againſt the mighty.</hi> Or, if we be <hi>cold</hi> and careleſſe herein, <hi>pinurious</hi> and tenacious of our <hi>worldly</hi> pelfe, preferring our <hi>gold</hi> before our <hi>God;</hi> or fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <hi>graceleſſe Rebels</hi> more then we love our <hi>gracious King,</hi> It may fall out, as Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, <hi>Quod non capit Chriſtus vapit fiſcus;</hi> or as it did with the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> who becauſe
