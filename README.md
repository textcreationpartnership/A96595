    _ CHAP. I. Sheweth who theſe Rebels were, how much they were obliged to their Governours, and yet how ungratefully they rebelled againſt them.

    _ CHAP. II. Sheweth againſt whom theſe men rebelled, that God is the giver of our Covernours; the ſeverall Offices of Kings and Prieſts; how they ſhould aſsiſt each other, and how the people labour to deſtroy them both.

    _ CHAP. III. Sheweth the aſſured teſtimonies of a good and lawfull Governour, their qualifications, or duties to them; and wherein our obedience to them conſiſteth.

    _ CHAP. IV. Sheweth the objection of the Rebels to juſtifie their Rebellion: the firſt part of it anſwered, that neither our compulſion to Idolatry, nor any other injury or tyranny ſhould move us to Rebell.

    _ CHAP. V. Sheweth by Scripture, the Doctrine of the Church, humane reaſon, and the welfare of the weale publique, that we ought by no means to rebell. A threefold power of every Tyrant. Three kinds of tyraunies. The doubtfull and dangerous events of Warre. Why many men rebell. Jehu's example not to be followed.

    _ CHAP. VI. Sheweth, that neither private men, nor the ſubordinate Magiſtrates,

Buchanans miſtake diſcovered, and the Anti-Cavalier confuted.

    _ CHAP. VII. Sheweth the reaſons and the examples that are alleadged to juſtifie Rebellion, and a full anſwer to each of them: God the immediate Author of Monarchie: inferiour Magiſtrats have no power but what is derived from the ſuperiour; and the ill ſucceſſe of all rebellious reſiſting of our Kings.

    _ CHAP. VIII. Sheweth that our Parliament hath no power to make warre againſt our King: Two maine Objections anſwered: The originall of Parliaments: The power of the King to call a Parliament to deny what he will, and to diſſolve it when he will. Why our King ſuffereth.

    _ CHAP. IX. Sheweth the unanimous conſent and teſtimonies of many famous learned men and Martyrs, both ancient and moderne, that have confirmed and juſtified the truth of the former Doctrine.

    _ CHAP. X. Sheweth the impudency of the Anti-Cavalier: How the Rebels deny they warre againſt the King: An unanſwerable Argument to preſſe obedience: A further diſcuſſion, whether for our Liberty Religion, or Lawes, we may reſiſt our Kings; and a patheticall diſſwaſion from Rebellion.

Diſobedience. 10. Reſiſtance.) they aſcended to the height of their Rebellion; and how theſe are the ſteps and the wayes to all Rebellions, and the reaſon which moved men to Rebell.
